I have three micro services course, assessment, results.   In course micro services we have entities like courseid, assessmentid, duration, course name... In assessment micro service we have entities like assessment id assessment name, result id, assessment type.. and in result micro service we have results, result id, percentage etc .. now I have to connect these three micro services in synchronous way using feign client in spring boot so that when I give courseid I have to get all the details regarding course... And using assessmentif I have to get all the assessments matched to that courseid... From assessment id I have to get all the resultsid related to that assessment id.. that details should be printed in hierarchical structure.. from courses to assessments ... From assessments to results.... General spring boot code for this application
